# Introduction
I hate the damn course and the fucking homework for sure. \
Anyway, I have to do somthing. Here, see my repo, you can \
detect faces using your camera. It may be not so accurate, but \
it works.

# Usage
Download the repo, and open it with your Android studio, I \
hope all goes fine.

# Note
The detetion code comes from [here](https://github.com/CitrusRokid/OpenNPD) And I train my own model \
and use [swig](https://github.com/EvergreenHZ/Lazy_Boy_Diary/tree/master/cross_compilation_android) to wrap it and provide interfaces \
for Android.
